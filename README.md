Hi,

Thank you for considering me for this internship.

I’m submitting this towards the very end of the 2.5 weeks allotted to me. I asked for feedback because I haven’t used NodeJS to make a project before and I didn't read the Alexa Skill Kit documentation from start to finish. The application isn't that robust ie. HelpIntent says instructions as opposed to instructions being an intent which may be costly (time, attention, etc. for the user). But I tried to include some creativity through the nostalgic sound assets, make the code organized and well documented, and handle errors or unexpected responses.

I’m a student at Pitzer College and I’m pursuing a computer science bachelor's at Harvey Mudd. Trying to design for reduced user attention, while keeping the code as simple as possible seems challenging, very interesting and I would like to learn how to build software that does this from a YC backed team. Please consider me further for an internship at Volley this summer.

The skill’s ARN is below along with the interaction model, model.json in the project's root directory, to try the skill further.

# Fizz-Buzz-Alexa
##### ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:041301154326:function:serverlessrepo-bull-frog-alexaskillskitnodejsfacts-1UYDRT9UVY6KD
### Demos
##### Full gameplay: https://youtu.be/oOxdgA38cTU
##### Exit test: https://youtu.be/Lpkn4iw0Hkk
##### Error test: https://youtu.be/okQx927ldYI

### Issues
##### 1. Improve control flow so levels work properly
##### 2. MC_START_01 (the gong sound effect) cuts too soon
##### 3. U_UNRECOGNIZED (error sound effect) needs to be changed so users can better discern an error
