Hi ,

Thank you for considering me for this internship.

I’m submitting this towards the very end of 2.5 weeks allotted to me. I asked for feedback because I haven’t used NodeJS to make a project before and I didn't read the Alexa Skill Kit documentation from start to finish. The application isn't that robust ie. HelpIntent says instructions as opposed to instructions being their own intent which may be costly (time, attention etc. for the user). But I tried to include some creativity through the nostalgic sound assets, make the code organized and well documented, and handle errors or unexpected responses.

Trying to design for reduced user attention, while keeping the code as simple as possible seems challenging, very interesting and I would like to learn how to build software that does this from a YC backed team.

Included is a demo of the project, a link to the GitHub repo. The GitHub repo contains the skill’s ARN (in the readme) along with the interaction model (model.json).
